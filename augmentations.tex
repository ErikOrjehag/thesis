\subsection{Data augmentation}

Following \cite{monodepth2} the ability to apply a random augmentation with 50\% chance to the training images will be implemented in the system. This can improve robustness and hopefully makes the CNN generalize and achieve better results on the unseen testing data. The following augmentations can be applied: Horizontal flip, random brightness, contrast, saturation and hue jitter.
