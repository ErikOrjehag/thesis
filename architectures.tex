\section{Architectures}

In order to predict depth and motion from monocular images two different CNN architectures are examined.

\subsection{SfMLearner architecture}
This is the architecture from \cite{sfmlearner}. The authors use a DispNet\cite{dispnet} architecture to predict depth maps at four different scales, and a ResNet18\cite{resnet} architecture with modified decoder to predict pose updates in an euler angle axis representation.



\subsection{Monodepth2 architecture}
This is the architecture from \cite{monodepth2}. The authors use a ResNet18 architecture instead of a DispNet architecture to predict depth estimates. They make this choice because its a smaller and faster architecture. Similarly they use a ResNet18 architecture with modified decoder to predict the pose updates in an euler angle axis representation.
