The best combination for depth and ego motion predictions.

Small disparity, large depth, for cars moving with the same relative speed, no ego motion.

Over-fitting while training homography.

Alterations needed to make consensus converge.

Future work to couple the training of depth, keypoints and consensus more tightly.
