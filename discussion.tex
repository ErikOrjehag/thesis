\section{Results}
The best combination for depth and ego motion predictions.

\section{Method}

Small disparity, large depth, for cars moving with the same relative speed, no ego motion.

TODO: Image of holes from small disparity

Over-fitting while training homography.

TODO: Plot over fitting. Image + Loss + Histogram

Alterations needed to make consensus converge.

Discuss evaluation metrics.

\section{The work in a wider context}

Positives: Reduced demand for owning cars, less oil consumption, less congestion, ride sharing.\cite{transportation}

Negatives: Impact on jobs, displace some jobs (truck drivers), create new jobs, its a debate.\cite{sociology}
