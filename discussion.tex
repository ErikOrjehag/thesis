\section{Results}
The best combination for depth and ego motion predictions.

\section{Method}

Small disparity, large depth, for cars moving with the same relative speed, no ego motion.

TODO: Image of holes from small disparity

Over-fitting while training homography.

TODO: Plot over fitting. Image + Loss + Histogram

Alterations needed to make consensus converge.

\section{Future work}

Future work to couple the training of depth, keypoints and consensus more tightly.

\section{Conclusion}
